                        <p>Have you thought about how much it would cost to replace the contents of your home if something unexpected were to happen? If you add up the costs of your furniture, soft furnishings, appliances, electrical items, clothing and valuables, it’s an incredibly expensive amount to find if they are damaged, stolen or destroyed. This is where Family Income Benefit comes in. Having this in place provides you with financial protection to cover the costs of replacing your possessions. <br><br>

                            At Trinity Finance, we help you put the right amount of cover in place for your home contents. Our mortgage and protection advisers can guide you on the types of Family Income Benefit available, how it works if you have to make a claim, what’s included and excluded from your policy, the optional cover you can have and how to work out what your belongings are worth.</p>

                            <h5 class="author__name">What is Family Income Benefit?</h5>
                            <p>Having Family Income Benefit in place ensures you’re covered for the cost of repairing or
                                rebuilding your property when it’s been damaged or destroyed by manmade or natural
                                disasters, such as fire, flooding, subsidence and vandalism. As well as the structure
                                and fixtures of your property, this insurance can also cover outbuildings, garages and
                                external items, such as drains, pipes, fences and cables, depending on your policy.</p>

                            <h5 class="author__name pt-4">Types of Family Income Benefit</h5>
                            <p>There are a few types of Family Income Benefit to choose from — sum insured, bedroom rated
                                and unlimited sum insured.</p>

                            <h6 class="pt-4">Sum insured</h6>
                            <p>For this type of policy, the amount you are covered for depends on the number of bedrooms
                                in your property. You don’t need to work out the rebuild cost as the bedroom-rated
                                amount is set by the insurer, which is much easier for you. However, the sum you’re
                                covered for may be a lot higher than it would actually cost to rebuild your property as
                                the insurer will protect you against being underinsured.</p>

                            <h6 class="pt-4">Bedroom rated</h6>
                            <p>For this type of policy, the amount you are covered for depends on the number of bedrooms
                                in your property. You don’t need to work out the rebuild cost as the bedroom-rated
                                amount is set by the insurer, which is much easier for you. However, the sum you’re
                                covered for may be a lot higher than it would actually cost to rebuild your property as
                                the insurer will protect you against being uninsured.</p>

                            <h6 class="pt-4">Unlimited sum insured</h6>
                            <p>This type of Family Income Benefit policy doesn’t have a cap on how much you can claim.
                                This gives you peace of mind that you’re not underinsured and means you don’t have to
                                work out your property’s rebuild cost. Some insurers have claim amount limits for their
                                standard policies so this is a good choice if the rebuild cost of your property is
                                likely to exceed that limit. Premiums tend to be higher for this option.</p>



                            <h5 class="author__name pt-4">What is covered with Family Income Benefit?</h5>
                            <p>The structure of your property is covered by Family Income Benefit, which includes the
                                roof, windows, ceilings, floors and walls. Fixtures are also covered, such as a fitted
                                kitchen, bathroom suite, built-in wardrobes and doors. As mentioned earlier, it can also
                                include structures that are outside your main building, such as your garage, driveway
                                and greenhouse. <br><br>

                                Whilst each insurer and policy is different, Family Income Benefit generally covers damage
                                caused by:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="my-4">

                            </ul>
                            <p>Some insurers include repairs to central heating systems and plumbing issues in their
                                standard Family Income Benefit cover. If this isn’t included in your policy, you can
                                usually include this as an optional add-on.</p>


                            <h5 class="author__name pt-4">What’s not covered with Family Income Benefit?</h5>
                            <p>A standard policy won’t normally cover you for:</p>
                            <ul class="my-4">
                                <li class="py-2"><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i> Wear and tear</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>The property fittings and your personal contents are also not covered by buildings
                                insurance. You’ll need to take out a separate Family Income Benefit policy for this type of
                                cover or a combined home insurance policy.</p>


                            <h5 class="author__name pt-4">Optional add-ons to your Family Income Benefit</h5>
                            <p>If you’d like extra cover to that offered by a standard policy, you can opt for some
                                add-ons. These can include accidental damage cover, home emergency cover and legal
                                services cover.</p>

                            <h6 class="pt-4">Accidental damage cover</h6>
                            <p>Accidents happen and accidental damage cover provides financial protection for
                                unintentional damage caused to your property’s structure or the fixtures. For example,
                                you might drill through a pipe by mistake, damage a kitchen unit, smash a window or
                                knock a hole in a wall.</p>

                            <h6 class="pt-4">Home emergency cover</h6>
                            <p>Be financially covered in an emergency when you add home emergency cover to your policy.
                                This covers you for unexpected problems, such as faulty electrics, broken door and
                                window locks, issues with drainage or plumbing, a faulty central heating system and
                                roofing issues. The costs of an emergency call-out for a tradesman along with the repair
                                charges are covered as well as the cost of overnight accommodation if you’re unable to
                                stay in your property.</p>

                            <h6 class="pt-4">Legal services cover</h6>
                            <p>This enables you to get legal advice, take advantage of legal services and benefit from
                                the payment of any legal costs that need to be covered. It provides cover for all manner
                                of issues, ranging from a boundary dispute with your neighbour to a compensation claim
                                from someone who has been injured while on your property. It also covers you for issues
                                that aren’t related to your property, such as employment disputes, and provides cover
                                for your loved ones as well as you. <br><br>

                            <h5 class="author__name pt-4">Do you need Family Income Benefit?</h5>
                            <p>Family Income Benefit isn’t a legal requirement but having this cover in place will be stipulated by your lender if you’re taking out a mortgage. This has to be arranged before the contracts can be exchanged. Even if you don’t have a mortgage, Family Income Benefit provides considerable financial protection should the worst happen to your property. It’s even more recommended if your property is in a high-risk area, such as one prone to flooding or with a high level of crime. <br><br>

                                If you’re a landlord, Family Income Benefit can cover the costs of any repairs that are needed to your investment property. If you own a leasehold property, you need to check your position with regard to Family Income Benefit. Usually, the freeholder is responsible for this so there’s no need for you to have a separate policy but be certain of this first. The freeholder may also have taken out Family Income Benefit but passed the cost onto you via your service charge.</p>




                            <h5 class="author__name pt-4">How to decide the value of your Family Income Benefit cover</h5>
                            <p>The amount of cover you have with your Family Income Benefit needs to be sufficient enough to pay the rebuild costs of your property. Should the worst happen and your property is destroyed, all materials, labour costs and professional fees need to be covered by your insurance. As mentioned earlier, the rebuild cost isn’t the same as the market value, which is how much your property is worth on the open market. The market value includes the value of the land your property has been built on as well as allowing for the property’s location, local amenities and other factors. The rebuild cost, therefore, is usually lower than this. So how exactly can you work out how much it would cost to rebuild your property from scratch?</p>

                            <h6 class="pt-4">The rebuild value</h6>
                            <p>This is determined by numerous factors, as detailed below.</p>
                            <ul class="my-4">
                                <li class="py-2"><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i> <strong>The size of your property.</strong> This matters because the larger it is, the more it will cost to rebuild.</li>
                                <li class="py-2"><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i> <strong>The type of property you have.</strong> For example, a detached, semi-detached or terraced house.</li>
                                <li class="py-2"><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i> <strong>The age of your property. </strong> This is important because the materials used to build older properties tend to be more expensive.</li>
                                <li class="py-2"><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i> <strong>The building materials used. </strong> These can significantly affect the rebuild value and a non-standard construction will increase the rebuild costs.</li>
                                <li class="py-2"><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i> <strong>Whether it’s a listed property. </strong> This is more than likely going to be more expensive to rebuild.</li>
                                
                            </ul>
                            <p>It’s a good idea to ask a chartered surveyor to estimate the rebuild value for you. This helps to ensure that you’re not either underestimating or overestimating the amount that you need to be insured for.</p>


                            <h5 class="author__name pt-4">How much does Family Income Benefit cost?</h5>
                            <p>As well as the rebuild value, other elements affect the cost of your Family Income Benefit policy. The location of your property, for example, is important. If it’s situated in a high-risk area, such as one with a high crime rate or one that’s prone to flooding, it has increased risk for the insurer because you’re more likely to claim. This, in turn, can increase your premiums. <br><br>

                                The level of cover provided by your policy also determines how much your premiums are. You may be happy with standard cover but, on the other hand, you may prefer the peace of mind that some add-ons provide despite the higher cost. An index-linked policy is worth considering as it increases over time in line with inflation to ensure that any increases in the rebuild costs are allowed for. If you’ve made previous claims on a Family Income Benefit policy, your premiums may increase.</p>

                                <h6 class="pt-4">Benefit from lower Family Income Benefit premiums</h6>
                            <p>There are various ways to keep the costs of your premiums down. One example is to install forms of security in your property, such as a surveillance camera or a burglar alarm system, helping to reduce the level of risk. Another way is to pay for your policy annually rather than monthly. If you choose the latter option, you end up paying interest on your monthly premiums, making your overall cost much more expensive.<br><br>

                                You can also benefit from lower premiums if you agree to pay a higher excess. Whenever you make a claim, you have to pay the compulsory excess. However, before taking out your policy, you can also agree to a voluntary excess amount. This has to be paid along with the compulsory excess in the event of a claim but you can normally benefit from having lower premiums. Generally, the higher the excess you agree to pay, the more you can expect the premiums to come down.<br><br>
                                
                                Also, try to keep your no claims discount (NCD) intact and refrain from making a claim. That way, the insurer is more likely to look favourably on you and reduce your premiums when your policy is due for renewal. Another way to save money is to consider combining your Family Income Benefit with Family Income Benefit. This is usually cheaper than taking out two separate policies.<br><br>
                                
                                When your policy is about to expire, get in touch with one of our mortgage and protection advisers rather than allowing it to auto-renew. They can review your circumstances and shop around for more competitive Family Income Benefit cover for you, helping you to save money on your premiums.</p>

                                <h5 class="author__name pt-4">Family Income Benefit for non-standard properties</h5>
                            <p>If your property has a non-standard construction, such as being built with a timber frame or having a thatched roof, the premiums for your Family Income Benefit are likely to be higher. This is because it will probably be more expensive to rebuild than a property made with brick walls and a tile roof, for example. A listed property is also classed as non-standard. In some cases, a specialist home insurance policy may be needed instead of standard Family Income Benefit.</p>

                                <h5 class="author__name pt-4">Other considerations when choosing your Family Income Benefit</h5>
                            <p>All Family Income Benefit policies are different and it’s important to check the aspects that are included. As well as confirming what’s covered with a standard policy and the add-ons you can choose from, think about what other features may be beneficial to you in the future. For example, if you use a tradesman recommended by the insurer to carry out repairs on your property, is a guarantee on their work offered? Do you have access to a 24-hour emergency helpline? Are you covered for replacement locks and keys should yours be stolen or lost? Check how much the compulsory excess is and if the insurer includes the entitlement to a no claims discount within their policy terms.</p>

                            <h6 class="pt-4">Alternative accommodation</h6>
                            <p>Be sure to check that alternative accommodation is allowed for in your policy. If your property is uninhabitable while repairs are being carried out following an incident, you’ll need somewhere else to stay. An alternative accommodation feature means the insurer will cover the cost of temporary accommodation until the works have been completed. There tends to be a limit on the amount for this so double-check what the figure is. This cover doesn’t just apply to a property you live in. If you’re a landlord, the insurer will pay for alternative accommodation for your tenants or pay you for the lost rent.</p>

                            <h6 class="pt-4">An unoccupied property</h6>
                            <p>Your Family Income Benefit policy may not be valid if you leave your property unoccupied for an extended length of time. This is usually considered to be over 30 consecutive days. It’s important to let your insurer know if this is likely to happen as there may be restrictions on your cover or you may need to take out an unoccupied home insurance policy.</p>

                            <h5 class="author__name pt-4">Review your Family Income Benefit policy</h5>
                            <p>As the cost to rebuild your property will go up over time, you should review the amount of cover you have before renewing your policy. That way, you can be certain you’re not underinsured and won’t have to pay for any of the costs should the worst happen to your property. Your insurer may automatically increase your cover via an index-linked policy to allow for this so be sure to check whether or not this is the case. <br><br>

                                You also need to review your policy if you make any changes to your property, such as converting the loft or adding an extension. Home improvements are likely to increase the rebuild costs of your property so you should make sure your cover amount reflects these changes. It’s actually best to notify your insurer before you start carrying out any works so that you don’t risk invalidating your policy.</p>
